# gossel
The plan of this project is to have a proof of concept of a nice IRC client like [Quassel](http://quassel-irc.org).

## Warning: ##
The code is pretty messy at the moment :)

## Building: ##
To build the core, change into the directory and do a `go build`.
The client can be built accordingly.
